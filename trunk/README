GameLib - January 14th, 2004 release
------------------------------------

This is a beta release of the GameLib multimedia/game library. General
information can be found at the website (http://www.adammil.net/GameLib)
and in the 'doc' folder.

Being a beta release, the API is subject to change between versions, but
for the large majority of the code base that's already stabilized, there
should be no further changes. In any case, any API changes between versions
will be prominently noted in the CHANGELOG file.

Using the library
-----------------
To use the library, build your application using the .NET framework and use
GameLib.dll as a reference, in addition to any references necessary for your
application. Then, you'll need to copy the DLLs from the 'debug' or 'release'
folder and the 'common' folder into a place where your executable can find
them. Not all the DLLs are strictly necessary, depending on what
functionality your application uses.
