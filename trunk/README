GameLib - June 28th, 2004 release
====================================

This is a beta release of the GameLib multimedia/game library. General
information can be found at the website (http://www.adammil.net/GameLib)
and in the 'doc' folder.

Being a beta release, the API is subject to change between versions, but
for the large majority of the code base that's already stabilized, there
should be no further changes. In any case, any API changes between versions
will be prominently noted in the CHANGELOG file.

For release notes, see the CHANGELOG file.

Project Status
==============
Legend:
Not Completed - No programming has been done for this subsystem.
In Progress   - Programming has been done, but the functionality and API are
                not complete.
Alpha         - The basic set of functionality has been written, but not
                enough testing has been done. Some items may not be
                fully implemented.
Beta          - The API has pretty much stabilized and the full set of
                functionality for the current milestone has been implemented.
Done          - The full functionality for the current milestone has been
                implemented and tested.

Component             Status
---------             ------
Interop               Beta

Video                 Beta
                      I'd like to add support for video decoding and
                      playback, but that's a lot of work to do portably,
                      so it's a low priority.

Low-level OpenGL      Beta
High-level OpenGL     In Progress
Font rendering        Beta

Audio                 Alpha (needs more thorough testing)
                      I'd like to add MP3 support, but I'm not sure about
                      legal issues. And OGG is a better format anyway. ;-)
                      I'd also like to add module support (IT, XM, etc),
                      but I haven't found a good, open-source decoder.
                      MikMod doesn't suit my needs as it cannot decode
                      multiple modules simultaneously. I've put some
                      effort into coding that functionality into MikMod,
                      but it's a low priority, and I'd really like to
                      find a better library.

CD Audio              Beta

Documentation         In Progress (this is a TREMENDOUS amount of work!)
Event handling        Beta

Input                 Beta
                      I'd like to do some testing with one of those mice
                      that has more than 3 buttons, or a rocker. Since my
                      mouse only has 3 buttons and a scroll wheel, that's
                      all that I've been able to test with.

Networking            Alpha/Beta/In Progress
                      The parts that are written seem to work pretty well,
                      but do need more testing. I'd like to eliminate the
                      requirement for multi-threading, though, and add a
                      class to simplify Peer-to-Peer applications. Also,
                      the networking code is not fully optimized.

Scripting             Not Completed/In Progress
                      Some preliminary development has been done, but given
                      .NET's ability to compile code on the fly, this is
                      somewhat of a low priority and may not even be
                      necessary or worthwhile.

Windowing             Alpha
                      It seems to work fairly well. However, I would like to
                      expand the set of base controls and improve support
                      for overlapping controls/windows.

Misc (IO, Timing)     Beta/Alpha
                      The formatted binary writing functions need more
                      testing.

Misc (Math)           Beta/In Progress
                      Much of the math code has been written and tested.
                      However, there are a number of classes that are not
                      fully implemented, yet.

Using the library
=================
To use the library, build your application using the .NET framework and use
GameLib.dll as a reference, in addition to any references necessary for your
application. Then, you'll need to copy the DLLs from the 'debug' or 'release'
folder and the 'common' folder into a place where your executable can find
them. Not all the DLLs are strictly necessary, depending on what
functionality your application uses.
