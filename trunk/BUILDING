Building - May 2nd, 2004 release
-------------------------------------

Currently, only building under Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio is
supported. Preliminary work getting things to compile under *nix with
gcc and mono has been done, but it's currently a low priority.

It wasn't until I tried writing these directions that I realized just how
complicated building the library from scratch is. Though it's complicated,
most of the steps only need to be done once. I'll try to simplify it, but
for now, I'll just release it as-is. 

If you simply want to develop using the library, I highly recommend you
download the prebuilt binary packages.

If you want to build it yourself, continue on.

Building under Visual Studio .NET
---------------------------------
1) Download the latest SDL development package from http://www.libsdl.org.
   The version I used to build the binary release was 1.2.7, available
   from this URL: http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.7-VC6.zip
2) Download the latest vorbis development library for Windows from
   http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp. I'd recommend the "Ogg Vorbis Win32
   SDK".
2) Unpack the SDL and vorbis libraries somewhere.
3) Edit the "Additional Include Directories" path (C++ -> General) for the
   Mixer, Utility, and VorbisWrapper to reference wherever you put the SDL
   and oggvorbis include files. Remember to make the changes for both debug
   and release builds.
4) Edit the "Additional Library Directories" path (Linker -> General) for
   those libraries to reference where you put the SDL and oggvorbis
   libraries. Remember to make the changes for both debug and release builds.
5) You'll need a copy of perl installed. I recommend ActiveState perl from
   http://www.activestate.com/. It should be installed so that perl is in
   your path, but if you don't want to do that, then you'll need to edit the
   "callconvhack.bat" file that comes with the GameLib source so that it can
   find your copy of perl.
6) You'll need at least version 1.1.4322 of the .NET framework from
   Microsoft, available here: http://www.microsoft.com/net/
   If you want to use a version other than the one above, you'll need to edit
   the "callconvhack.bat" file to reference the new version.
7) Build the GameLib, Mixer, Utility, VorbisWrapper, and libsoundfile
   projects. You should be able to use the project files I've included along
   with the source. You may want to create a solution containing them so they
   can be built all at once.
8) If you want to build the documentation, you'll need a program to convert
   the GameLib.dll and GameLib.xml files output by Visual Studio into the
   actual help files. I use NDoc (from http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/), and
   have included an NDoc project file.
9) In order to use the library, you'll still need the DLLs from the
   SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_gfx libraries, from the following URLs:
     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
     http://www.ferzkopp.net/~aschiffler/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/ (you'll need to build this one)
   The SDL_gfx DLL is called sdlgfx.dll.
   Or, you can just get them from the binary release of GameLib.
10) Take a look at the README file for instructions on using the library.

Now, don't you wish you'd just used the prebuilt package? :-)
